    solar technology converts sunlight into electricity that can be used, stored, or transmitted
<h2 className="relative flex justify-center overflow-hidden bg-black-500 py-6 sm:py-12, text-2xl text-red-500">How it works</h2>     
    PV cells, also known as solar cells, are made of semiconductor materials that absorb photons, or particles of light, from sunlight. The absorbed photons dislodge electrons from the material's atoms, which are then collected to generate an electric current.

    A PV system includes solar panels, an inverter, and interconnection wiring. Solar panels are made up of individual PV cells that are connected together in chains called modules. 
<h4 className="relative flex justify-center overflow-hidden bg-black-500 py-6 sm:py-12, text-2xl text-red-500">Types of PV cells</h4>  
    PV cells can be made from different materials, including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous silicon. Monocrystalline cells are the most efficient, while amorphous silicon cells are the least efficient but also the cheapest. 
<h5 className="relative flex justify-center overflow-hidden bg-black-500 py-6 sm:py-12, text-2xl text-red-500">Benefits</h5>
    PV energy is a clean, renewable energy source that doesn't emit toxic substances or contaminants into the air. 
<h6 className="relative flex justify-center overflow-hidden bg-black-500 py-6 sm:py-12, text-2xl text-red-500">Challenges</h6>
    However, PV power production does have some environmental costs. For example, the materials used to build the cells are potentially unsustainable and will run out eventually. There are also no viable technologies for recycling solar waste.
